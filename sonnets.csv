That thereby beauty's rose might never die,

Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.

And only herald to the gaudy spring,

25.0,"Let those who are in favor with their stars
Of public honor and proud titles boast,
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlook'd for joy in that I honor most.
Great princes' favorites their fair leaves spread

And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.

After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Is from the book of honor rased quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd.

153.0,"Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep;
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
I sick withal the help of bath desired,
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest;
But found no cure: the bath for my help lies

154.0,"The little Love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire,
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd,
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseas'd, but I, my mistress' thrall,
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove:
